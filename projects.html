          <h3>Snake Game</h3>
          <p>The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where you control a snake that grows longer each time it eats food. The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own tail while trying to score as many points as possible. As the snake eats, it becomes harder to maneuver, increasing the challenge. The game ends when the snake hits an obstacle, testing your reflexes and aiming for the highest score.</p>

          <h3>Online Code Compiler</h3>
          <p>This is a web-based **Online Code Compiler** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to write, compile, and run code in multiple programming languages directly in the browser. The backend handles code execution securely, while the frontend provides an interactive and user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates how the MERN stack can be leveraged to create a fully functional web application that supports multiple languages and provides real-time feedback to users.</p>
